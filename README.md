## Description
After grasping the basics of React and learning about NextJS, I decided that I would create a personal page where I would post my description so that people could get to know me, and also see my projects.

## Walkthrough
This is the preview:

Main idea was to keep it simple. I did not used flashy things, because I feel like I did not need them.

Hovewer I did implement clickable dark/light mode, try it and choose which one do you prefer! I'm definitely the dark theme guy.

If you scroll down you will se a couple of picked by me projects.
