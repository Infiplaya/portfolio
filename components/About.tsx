        I am Pawe≈Ç, a self-taught programmer who wants to learn a lot
        about web development and build cool and beautiful stuff! I have studied
        cognitive science but discovered a true passion for programming and
        decided that the path is for me. Currently deeply interested in Web
        Development, especially the front end. Every day I improve my knowledge
        and skills by building projects and learning.
